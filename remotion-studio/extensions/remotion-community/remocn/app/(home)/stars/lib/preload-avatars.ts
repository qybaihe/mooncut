/**
 * Warm the browser cache for the stargazer avatars BEFORE the Remotion Player
 * mounts. The composition renders them with Remotion's <Img> (which blocks the
 * first frame via delayRender until each image loads). If the Player autoPlays
 * into a batch of un-cached remote avatars it buffers and doesn't reliably
 * resume — the preview appears frozen until you manually pause/play. Preloading
 * first makes <Img> resolve from cache instantly, so autoPlay just works.
 *
 * `crossOrigin = "anonymous"` MUST match Remotion's <Img> so the CORS-enabled
 * cache entry is reused (otherwise the browser keeps a separate entry and
 * Remotion re-fetches). Each image resolves on load OR error (a broken avatar
 * must not block), and the whole batch is bounded by a timeout so one slow image
 * can't stall the transition to the ready state.
